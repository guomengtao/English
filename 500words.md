#### HAVE FUN!

It can be hard to motivate yourself to learn English sometimes. Remind yourself why you want to learn English when you are feeling demotivated. And have fun with the words you learn! Try and practice using your newly learnt words with friends and family. Use the words in sentences and different situations when you can.

Studying the most important words in English is good but **using them in real life** is so much better!
