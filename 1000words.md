Building your vocabulary with some of the most common words used in the English language is a great start for your journey in learning this beautiful language.

Not only do these common words expand the English terminology that you know, but they also help you with your English conversation skills since they are indeed words that you hear others use everyday.

If you know 1,000 words, you will be between a **functional beginner**  and **conversational** level in English. In most of the world’s languages, 500 words will be more than enough to get you through any tourist situations and everyday introductions.

## Start Building Your Vocabulary With Everyday Common Words

Using everyday common words are the most convenient way to learn English. The more you hear these words, the better it is for you to process and understand them.

And the more you use them, the stronger your English skills become. So it’s a great process of learning from others, and at the same time, learning from yourself, too!

## Why Do You Need To Build Your Vocabulary?

### Before we check out the list of the most commonly used English words, let’s quickly go through the reasons why it’s important for you to build your vocabulary.

1.  While thoughts can shape our words, words can also definitely shape our thoughts. So building a good set of words inside your vocabulary allows you to enhance your thinking patterns. English is such a dynamic and wonderful language, you’ll never grow tired of all the wonderful things you can learn and re-learn from it, just by simply constantly supplementing the English words you know.
2.  And speaking of supplementing, think of your vocabulary as some sort of vitamin for your entire body of English knowledge. The more words you know, the healthier your English knowledge and skills are.
3.  While learning common words in English is a great start, it will also definitely give you the push you need to level up on the words you know. Before you know it, you’ll be conversant and well-informed in more advanced types of the English terminology.
